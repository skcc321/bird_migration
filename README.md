# BirdMigration
Let's assume you have 3 pending migrations with no order.

 Status   Migration ID    Migration Name
--------------------------------------------------
   up     20181029224028  Create users
  down    20181029224048  Create add surname to users
   up     20181029224059  Create posts
   up     20181029224112  Create test los
  down    20181029224146  Create lalas
  down    20181029224451  Lololo

And some of them (let it be '20181029224451  Lololo') is broken.
And you are going to deploy that code somewhere.
So if you simply run `rake db:migrate` you will have on the server
two passed migrations and an error.

 Status   Migration ID    Migration Name
--------------------------------------------------
   up     20181029224028  Create users
   up     20181029224048  Create add surname to users
   up     20181029224059  Create posts
   up     20181029224112  Create test los
   up     20181029224146  Create lalas
  down    20181029224451  Lololo

So state was not reverted to the same what was before `rake db:migrate` state.
